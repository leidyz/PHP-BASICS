/*Create a program that lists the grades of the students in a class. 
For this we will have to use an associative array where the key will be the name of each student.
 Each student will have 5 marks (valued from 0 to 10).

In addition, create a function that, given the grades of all the students, 
shows us both the average grade of each student and the average grade of the entire class.
